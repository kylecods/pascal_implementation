## Pascal Java

This is an implementation of the Pascal language(possibly others) in Java. The reference book used is **Writing Compilers and Interpreters A Software Engineering Approach by Ronald Mak**.
This is an effort to further increase knowledge in programming language writing and design. The frontend and backend parts are decoupled making it quite possible to implement other languages easily.

#### Building
It is written using Intellij IDE with the [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) build tool.
